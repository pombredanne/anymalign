1. What were the most difficult parts of Anymalign to understand?
 Why (because too many versions, because too many papers, etc.)?

   >understand
   >find light of enligntenment
   >the code

2. What are the advantages of Anymalign over other subsentential alignment tools or techniques?

   >not depending on huge data
   >scalable
   >memory conservative
   >can run in parallel , even distributed

   Can you name some of these tools or techniques?
   >giza++ / grow-diag-final ?

3. The ultimate goal is to have Anymalign do a better job than Giza++/Moses in conjonction with the Moses SMT engine builder.
   Can you suggest how to achieve this goal?
   Can you justify your suggestion?

   >make use of multicore processors?

4. Anymalign has been designed for subsentential alignment.
   Can you imagine other applications of Anymalign, possibly in totally unrelated domains?

   >the kernel idea is "collocation"
   >in NLP: unsupervised phrase mining?
